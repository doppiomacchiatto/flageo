Tilemill mbtiles for the State of Florida
=========
I created the map layers on Tilemill from PostGIS and Shapefile data sets.  Also, I loaded the maps in mapbox.

1. FlaPop.mbtiles = contains a map of the State of Florida's population broken down by county.
2. fla-mil.mbtiles = contains a map of the militarty installations in the State of Florida.
